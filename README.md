This repo contains all four projects for the Computer Architecture class at NOVA SST 2022/2023. They were made in tandem with @R-Bartmoss.

The languages used were Bash (Shell scripting), C and x86-64 Assembly.

**First project** (Bash): a sha1sum-based file comparer (diff command clone).

**Second project** (C): a minimal CPU architecture clone that can read machine instructions and execute them to manipulate data on memory addresses.

**Third project** (x86-64 ASM): a heap simulator with metadata on assembly (malloc C function clone for allocation, free C function clone for deallocation, and find_block to find a usable heap memory block)

**Fourth project** (x86-64 ASM): a program to read a malware file and find the password to defuse it (strings command clone).
